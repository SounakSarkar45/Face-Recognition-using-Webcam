This project uses the following tools for its implementation:
1) Python: The programming language used to implement this Project.
2) Jupyter notebook: Used to provide an interactive environment for python, for the 
implementation of this project.
3) OpenCV: Is an image and video processing library and is used for image and video 
analysis, like facial detection, license plate reading, photo editing, advanced robotic 
vision, optical character recognition, and a whole lot more.
4) dlib: The dlib library, maintained by Davis King, contains our implementation of “deep 
metric learning” which is used to construct our face embeddings used for the actual 
recognition process.
5) Face Recognition: The face_recognition library, created by Adam Geitgey, wraps around 
dlib’s facial recognition functionality, and this library is super easy to work with and we 
will be using this in our code. Remember to install dlib library first before you install 
face_recognition.
